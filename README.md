## Description

The **Valk Virus** collection is a variety of harmless "nuisance" viruses. They simulate disruptive behavior such as scrambling text, spamming keystrokes, and randomizing system functions to confuse the user. These viruses are ideal for penetration testing (pen-testing) environments, game jam projects, or educational experiments.
